# Ads API Client Libraries for Ruby

This project hosts the new Ads common framework for Ruby, as well as the Ruby client libraries for the various SOAP-based Ads APIs at Google.

The Ruby client libraries make it easier to write Ruby clients to programmatically access your accounts.

New to the library? Check out the [Getting Started video screencast on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJx6oRyZx2Y) and take a look at the [wiki for this project](https://github.com/googleads/google-api-ads-ruby/wiki).

## Getting started

1. Install your library of choice using Rubygems.

  ```
  $ gem install google-adwords-api
  $ gem install google-dfp-api
  ```

1. Copy the sample config file (**adwords_api.yml** or **dfp_api.yml**) for your product to your home directory
and fill out the required properties.

  * [adwords_api.yml](https://github.com/googleads/google-api-ads-ruby/blob/master/adwords_api/adwords_api.yml)
  * [dfp_api.yml](https://github.com/googleads/google-api-ads-ruby/blob/master/dfp_api/dfp_api.yml)

1. Setup your OAuth2 credentials.

  The AdWords and DoubleClick for Publishers APIs use
[OAuth2](http://oauth.net/2/) as the authentication mechanism. Follow the appropriate guide below based on your use case.
